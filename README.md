This project (keynav) only works on X11, but if you want to use a similar tool for Windows, check out [keynavish](https://github.com/lesderid/keynavish)!


Compiling
---------

You may need some extra libraries to compile keynav.  On Debian and Ubuntu you can install these packages:

    sudo apt-get install libcairo2-dev libxinerama-dev libxdo-dev libxrandr-dev

Next you simply run make:

    make

This will produce an executable `./keynav` which may be run directly (or copied
somewhere in your path). You can also install (by default directly to `/usr`)
via `make install`.

On FreeBSD (and, I expect, other non-GNU platforms), you will want to use gmake.


FAQ
---

Q: What platforms are supported?
A: keynav should work on nearly any Unix-like that runs X11. It has been
confirmed to work on extremely varied GNU/Linux systems (incuding RPM-based,
Debian derivatives, musl-based systems, and Arch), and FreeBSD. If you get it to
run elsewhere, please let me know so I can add it to the list. If you try to run
it on another Unix-like and have trouble, please get in touch and I'll try to
help. If attempting to run elsewhere, note that we currently have a dependency
on GNU Make (gmake), and it hasn't been tested with many compilers yet.

Q: Does it work on Android/Windows/Wayland/iOS/...?
A: Sadly, no; keynav is totally dependent on X11, and porting it to any other
graphical system would really be a clone/rewrite. Although I am aware of no
exact analogues on other systems, I suggest looking into Tasker (Android),
AutoHotKey (Windows), and AppleScript (macOS). If you find something that works,
let me know and I'll consider adding it to this list.

Q: Can I use keynav to scroll?
A: Yes! X11 represents mouse scrolling as key presses, so you just add the
relevant stanza to your keynavrc.  Mouse buttons are
1=left, 2=middle, 3=right, 4=scroll-up, 5=scroll-down, 6=scroll-left, 7=scroll-right. So for example to scroll up with i and down with e:
```
i click 4,end
e click 5,end
```
or to keep scrolling without having to re-invoke keynav, remove the end command from the bindings, like this:
```
i click 4
```
